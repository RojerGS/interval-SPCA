## Symbolic Formulation for Principal Component Analysis of Interval-Valued Data

This repository holds the code that implements a fully symbolic formulation of Principal Component Analysis for interval-valued data.
This is a product of my MSc thesis.
The code, as submitted for my MSc thesis, can be found in the [`thesis`](https://github.com/RojerGS/interval-SPCA/tree/thesis) branch of this repository.
